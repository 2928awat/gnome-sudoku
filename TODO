help is not working

about dialog: update copyright person/year
about dialog: artwork has "placeholder"

"show possible numbers" results in critical warning. No result
"warn about unfillable squares" results in critical warning. No result

Print/print multiple: just writes TODO to terminal

Undo/redo are clickable, even before starting a game

"Saved game" shown in start screen, even if none exist

The first number of a game is not updated on the screen before the selector is moved to a different place.

The "Back" back seems to function like undo. Is that the case?

The ingame Help: (I like it!)
  Should maybe have different name. Help is the common word for opening the help manual.
  Left align the text
  Perhaps start with a general description of the method, instead of repeating the same sentance for each line.

No way to save a game
