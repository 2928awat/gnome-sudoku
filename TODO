help is not working

about dialog: update copyright person/year
about dialog: artwork has "placeholder"

"show possible numbers" results in critical warning. No result
"warn about unfillable squares" results in critical warning. No result

Undo/redo are clickable, even before starting a game

"Saved game" shown in start screen, even if none exist

No way to know if a game has already been played or not:
  For this SudokuTracker class needs to be ported. Once it is complete, enable the corresponding options -
  'MarkAsPlayedToggle' and 'includeOldGamesToggle' in data/print_games.ui (for multiple print dialog)
  
Currently we only read sudokus from data files:
  We need to complete the port of SudokuGenerator class to be able to generate sudokus as desired.
