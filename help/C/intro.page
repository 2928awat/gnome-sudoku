<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gnome Sudoku is an application to generate and play games of Sudoku, a popular number-based logic puzzle in which one must fill a 9 X 9 square with the correct digits.</p>
<p>
Sudoku  generates unique, symmetrical puzzles and rates their difficulty. Games can be played or printed, so GNOME Sudoku can be used to <link xref="index#print">print</link> out a set of puzzles to take with you or to play a  puzzle at a time on screen. All games persist across sessions and you can <link xref="save-resume#resume">resume</link> any old game
at any time, as well as replay any game you've already won.
